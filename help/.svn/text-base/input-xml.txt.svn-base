                                     found in the path from the root(s) to an

                                     single root, and only its value and
                                     attributes are returned; Auto: select
                                     best mode after analyzing schema
                                     [default value=Auto]
 -iTsFormat <timestamp format>     : Format of TIMESTAMP fields [default
                                     value=yyyy-MM-dd?hh:mm:ss]
 -dtNodes   <number of leaf nodes> : Parse this amount of leaf nodes to
                                     detect schema at runtime; -1 = parse
                                     whole document [default value=-1]
 -fNames    Compact|XPath          : Field names; Compact: each field name is
                                     the element\attribute name; XPath: each
                                     field name is the XPath query for the

 Field names and types are retrieved at runtime from the specified input file(s)
